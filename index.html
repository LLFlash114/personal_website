          <p>
            My name is <strong>Rajveer Singh</strong> and I was born in 2004.
            Week 3 of the CIT program has been <em>very</em> stressful.
            [Update - <strong>WEEK 8</strong>] Week 8 has been more relaxed as
            opposed to week 7 because we had midterms. My
            favorite class in this program has been System Admins. Web
            Technologies is a close second. I went to
            Sullivan Heights Secondary and North Surrey Secondary for
            highschool. Grade 8 in North Surrey and
            9-12 in Sullivan. High school feels like a walk in the park compared
            to this program.
          </p>

            Having time for my own hobbies is <em>extremely rare</em> due to the
            amount of assignments teachers at BCIT
            assign. I would like to consider <strong>Python</strong> and
            <strong>HTML</strong> as hobbies but theres never any time to
            practice them.
            During my free time I like to play <cite>League of Legends</cite> or
            watch movies, which theres also never time for.
